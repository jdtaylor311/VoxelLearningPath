 Console Loops & Functions
 ============================================================================
 Key concepts to focus on: loops, functions, basic program structure

 RULES:
 1) Do NOT paste solutions from elsewhere. Write it yourself.
 2) Keep the program minimal; one clear goal at a time.
 3) Commit when you hit acceptance criteria.

 TASKS:
 1. Make a number guessing game 1..100.
 2. Randomly pick a number at program start.
 3. Loop: ask for guess; print 'higher'/'lower' until correct.
 4. Count attempts and print total at the end.
 5. Put input logic in a function; put feedback logic in another function.

 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
 - Correct game flow; attempts counted; replay works.

 STRETCH GOALS:
 - Limit invalid input retries.
 - Let the user play again without restarting the program.

 HINTS (read only if stuck):
 - Search: 'c++ random number' and read <random> docs.
 - Validate std::cin and clear failbit on invalid input.
