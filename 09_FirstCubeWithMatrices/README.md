============================================================================
 Draw Your First 3D Cube
 ============================================================================
 Suggested libs for this step: glfw3, glad, glm
 Key concepts to focus on: buffers, shaders, matrices

 RULES:
 1) Do NOT paste solutions from elsewhere. Write it yourself.
 2) Keep the program minimal; one clear goal at a time.
 3) Commit when you hit acceptance criteria.

 TASKS:
 1. Define vertex positions for a cube (only positions).
 2. Upload to GPU buffers (VBO/VAO).
 3. Write minimal vertex/fragment shaders.
 4. Create a perspective projection and a view matrix.
 5. Render a rotating cube.

 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
 - Spinning cube visible; resizes correctly on window resize.

 STRETCH GOALS:
 - Add per-vertex color or a uniform color.

 HINTS (read only if stuck):
 - Use GLM for mat4; multiply MVP = projection * view * model.
