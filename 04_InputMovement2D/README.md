 Keyboard Movement (2D)
 ============================================================================
 Suggested libs for this step: sfml
 Key concepts to focus on: input handling, vectors

 RULES:
 1) Do NOT paste solutions from elsewhere. Write it yourself.
 2) Keep the program minimal; one clear goal at a time.
 3) Commit when you hit acceptance criteria.

 TASKS:
 1. Draw a small circle.
 2. Move the circle with arrow keys.
 3. Prevent moving off-screen.

 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
 - Smooth movement; no jitter; clamped to window bounds.

 STRETCH GOALS:
 - Add variable speed with Shift (run).
 - Add diagonal normalization (consistent speed).

 HINTS (read only if stuck):
 - Track a velocity vector; apply per-frame movement with a fixed speed.
