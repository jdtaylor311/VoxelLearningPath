============================================================================
 Voxel Meshing â€” Greedy Meshing
 ============================================================================
 Key concepts to focus on: optimization, algorithms

 RULES:
 1) Do NOT paste solutions from elsewhere. Write it yourself.
 2) Keep the program minimal; one clear goal at a time.
 3) Commit when you hit acceptance criteria.

 TASKS:
 1. Implement greedy meshing to merge adjacent coplanar faces into larger quads.
 2. Compare triangle count before/after to verify improvement.
 3. Keep block face material so texture mapping can vary by block type.

 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
 - Significant reduction in quad count vs naive face culling (50%+).

 STRETCH GOALS:
 - Try different scan orders; measure performance impact.

 HINTS (read only if stuck):
 - Research 'greedy meshing voxels'.
