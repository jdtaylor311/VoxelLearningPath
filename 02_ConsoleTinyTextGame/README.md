 Tiny Text Adventure
 ============================================================================
 Key concepts to focus on: state machine thinking, basic data structures

 RULES:
 1) Do NOT paste solutions from elsewhere. Write it yourself.
 2) Keep the program minimal; one clear goal at a time.
 3) Commit when you hit acceptance criteria.

 TASKS:
 1. Create a 3-room text adventure with choices (1/2/3).
 2. Store room data in a small struct or simple data structure.
 3. Add an inventory with up to 3 items (vector or array).
 4. Win condition: reach the exit with a specific item.

 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
 - Reachable win path; no soft-locks; inventory displayed when asked.

 STRETCH GOALS:
 - Add save/load to a text file.

 HINTS (read only if stuck):
 - Start with a simple state machine: currentRoom, hasItem flags.
